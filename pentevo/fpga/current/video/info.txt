1. Palette
----------

CRAM has 256 cells and is 15 bits wide. It codes color info as following:
+--------------------+
| 15     8  7      0 |
| xRRrrrGG  gggBBbbb |
+--------------------+
RR/GG/BB is Pentevo video-DAC and rrr/ggg/bbb are PWM 'boost'.
If you not intend to use PWN functionality, just set rrr/ggg/bbb to 3'b000
to obtain regular Pentevo colors.
When any of RR/GG/BB are 2'b11, the correspondent rrr/ggg/bbb are ignored
as DAC value of 2'b11 simply cannot be 'boosted'.
x is ignored value.

Mode ZX uses palette cells #F0-#F7 for BRIGHT 0 and #F8-#FF for BRIGHT 1.

Mode HC (16c) uses palette cells #E0-#EF.

Mode XC (256c) uses palette cells #00-#FF.

Mode GS (Gigascreen) uses palette cells addressed as following:
+----------+
| 7      0 |
| IGRBigrb |
+----------+
IGRB is pixel color from screen 1 and igrb - from screen 0.
Thus, you can tune the color 'blending' from two screens using the palette.
Some Gigascreen palette should be calculated using 'sophisticated' Excel tool or something.

2. Addresses

Mode ZX is at offset of #0000 and #1800 at selected video page as usually.
