Fixes:
 -  migrate 16c to bw 1/4 from 2/8
 -  learn what is read to rddata by c4
 -  make less power-off delay (apx. 2 sec)
 -  IM2 vector to Z80 bus (RTFM)
 -  SYSConfig and CPU clock select
 -  add paging for 0000-BFFF
 -  fix Xscroll for text mode
 -  fix vertical blank for border 1 line lag
 -  fix hi-res 1st pixel lag
 -  unify the lo/hi-res video data processing for tv/vga (border apparently)
 -  make proper clocked altdprams
 -  make CRAM clocked: zclk for WE and fclk for RE
 -  make proper video buffering to avoid Qua's yelling
 -  check timings for video
 -  make c0 sync for dram.v (if necessary though)
 -  search ways to optimize huge LC usage - one-hot style selectors
 -  check border effects on INT position

Features:
 -  horizontal scrollers
 -  vertical scrollers (unified with Tile mode)
 -  gigascreen mode
 -  s/w writes to X/Y counters on-the-fly
 -  RAM / ROM paging
