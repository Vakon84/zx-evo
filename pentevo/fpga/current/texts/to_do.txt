
Fixes:
 - check unnecessary wait sources/conditions (e.g. IDE)
 - optimize timings (negative slack on DRAM addr muxes)
 - DMA: access to devices with ports blocking strobes
 - fix all oddies with raster: INT 1 pixel delay (test on MULFIX), hblank etc
 - fix vertical blank for border 1 pixel at the upper-right corner
 - fix PWM for TV (make smoother)
 - migrate video fetcher to c2
 - investigate and longer 14mhz wait length for IOs (if need)
 - search ways to optimize huge LC usage:
    * one-hot style selectors = use if...elseif constructions instead of if...if


Features to add:
 - 3 color bits to unused signals
 - RFSH 28MHz burst
 - Yscroll array
 - migrate paging to FPRAM
 - RRRGGGBB using IDE_RDY and IDE_RES as additional bit, create 2nd project, add to compile
 - AY frequency (2MHz for Atari and 1MHz for Amstrad)
 - move all ports to fclk
 - copper
 - re-factor Z80 clock module (double-edge trigger)
 - 28 MHz for Z80 (?)
 - 512 bytes no-wait buffer
 - make less power-off delay (apx. 2 sec) on AVR
 ? LOAD "" for COM-port using X-modem
 - find solution to mix BEEP and TAPE simultaneously
 - combine TS and Base confs to one AVR firmware (selection by Turbo key)
 - line-delay ports: 86 bits
