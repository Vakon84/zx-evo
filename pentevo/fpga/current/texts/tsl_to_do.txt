
DMA:
 - access to devices with ports blocking strobes
 - move DMA wait to cycles with Z80 stall

Features:
 - debug TS engine
 - move TS higher priority cycles to Z80 stall
 - move all ports to fclk
 - copper
 ? blitter accelerated by commands like 'ld c,c'
 ? horizontal scrollers (array)
 ? vertical scrollers (unified with Tile mode)
 - re-factor Z80 clock module (double-edge trigger)
 - 28 MHz for Z80
 - 512 bytes no-wait buffer
 - IM2 vector to Z80 bus (RTFM z80 UM)
 - make less power-off delay (apx. 2 sec) on AVR
 ? LOAD "" for COM-port using X-modem
 - version read (AVR wait ports) ? is already

Fixes:
 - optimize timings (negative slack on DRAM addr muxes)
 - demo001 glitch at 7mhz
 - check stop times of video fetching
 - fix all oddies with raster: INT 1 pix shift, hblank etc
 - fix vertical blank for border 1 pixel at the upper-right corner
 - fix PWM for TV (make smoother)
 - migrate video fetcher to c2
 - make proper clocked altdprams
 - investigate and longer 14mhz wait length
 - search ways to optimize huge LC usage:
    - one-hot style selectors = use if...elseif constructions instead of if...if
    - muxes + summators -> summators only
