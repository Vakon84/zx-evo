
DMA:
 - access to devices with ports blocking strobes

Features:
 - move all ports to fclk
 - copper
 - re-factor Z80 clock module (double-edge trigger)
 - 28 MHz for Z80
 - 512 bytes no-wait buffer
 - make less power-off delay (apx. 2 sec) on AVR
 ? LOAD "" for COM-port using X-modem
 - find solution to mix BEEP and TAPE simultaneously
 - combine TS and Base confs to one AVR firmware (selection by Turbo key)
 - AY frequency (2MHz for Atari and 1MHz for Amstrad)

Fixes:
 - line-delay ports: 86 bits

 - optimize timings (negative slack on DRAM addr muxes)
 - find demo001 glitch at 7mhz bug
 - check stop times of video fetching
 - fix all oddies with raster: INT 1 pix shift, hblank etc
 - fix vertical blank for border 1 pixel at the upper-right corner
 - fix PWM for TV (make smoother)
 - migrate video fetcher to c2
 - make proper clocked altdprams
 - investigate and longer 14mhz wait length for IOs (if need)
 - search ways to optimize huge LC usage:
    - one-hot style selectors = use if...elseif constructions instead of if...if
