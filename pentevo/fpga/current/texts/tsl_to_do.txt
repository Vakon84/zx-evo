
DMA:
 - access to devices ports with blocking strobes
 - blitter
 
Fixes:
 - fix vertical blank for border 1 pixel at the upper-right corner
 - fix all oddies with raster: INT 1 pix shift, hblank etc
 - fix PWM for TV (make smoother)
 - migrate video fetcher to c2
 - SYSConfig and CPU clock select
 - make proper clocked altdprams
 - make CRAM clocked: zclk for WE and fclk for RE
 - investigate and longer 14mhz wait length
 ? fix Xscroll for text mode
 - search ways to optimize huge LC usage - one-hot style selectors

Features:
 - DOS switch to RAM #nn when in/out to VG93 and FDDVirt[(#FF)]
 - block INT when virt DOS
 - WP for RAM
 - back to DOS by ld b,b (opcode #40) + jmp nnnn (next but one M1)
 - version read (AVR wait ports)
 ? horizontal scrollers (array)
 ? vertical scrollers (unified with Tile mode)
 - 512 bytes no-wait buffer
 - IM2 vector to Z80 bus (RTFM z80 UM)
 ? LOAD "" for COM-port using X-modem
 - make less power-off delay (apx. 2 sec) on AVR
 
 

NOTES:

When add addr mux for TS address - clk slack is getting "-".
Fix it by optimizing timings.

Sprites:

 Nr of sprites: 42 (252 bytes)
 Sized: 16/32/48/64 pix individually for X and Y
 Min sprite (16x16) = 128 bytes = 64 words (6 bits)
 Max sprite (64x64) = 2048 bytes = 1024 words
 Total addressable space 21 - 6 = 15 bits
