1. Palette
----------

CRAM has 256 cells and is 15 bits wide. It codes color info as following:
+--------------------+
| 15     8  7      0 |
| xRRrrrGG  gggBBbbb |
+--------------------+
RR/GG/BB is Pentevo video-DAC and rrr/ggg/bbb are PWM 'boost'.
If you not intend to use PWN functionality, just set rrr/ggg/bbb to 3'b000
to obtain regular Pentevo colors.
When any of RR/GG/BB are 2'b11, the correspondent rrr/ggg/bbb are ignored
as DAC value of 2'b11 simply cannot be 'boosted'.
x is ignored value.

Mode ZX uses palette cells #F0-#F7 for BRIGHT 0 and #F8-#FF for BRIGHT 1.

Mode HC (16c) uses palette cells #E0-#EF.

Mode XC (256c) uses palette cells #00-#FF.

Text mode uses the same palette that ZX.


2. Addresses
------------

Mode ZX is at offset of #0000 and #1800 at selected video page as usually.

Mode 16c occupies 8 pages, so 32 screens can be selected.
It is located at pages 0-7 starting from the visible page selected (bits 0-2 are ignored).
Example:
Page 5 selected: graphics at pages 0-7 at #C000-#FFFF.

Mode 256c occupies 16 pages, so 16 screens can be selected.
It is located at pages 0-15 starting from the visible page selected (bits 0-3 are ignored).
Example:
Page 5 selected: graphics at pages 0-15 at #C000-#FFFF.

Text mode occupies 16kB of text + 2 kB of font.
Text area is located at visible page selected (bit 0 is ignored).
Font is located at next to visible page at offset #0000.
Example:
Page 5 selected: text at page 4 at #C000-#FFFF,
font at page 5 at #C000-$CFFF.
The attributes in this mode are:
+----------+
| 7      0 |
| IGRBigrb |
+----------+
IGRB is paper color for the symbol, and igrb is ink color.


3. Ports
--------

Ports are arranged as #nnAF, where nn is a register number.

1  - VPage		(Visible page)
2  - XOffsL		(X Offset)
3  - XOffsH
4  - YOffsL		(Y Offset)
5  - YOffsH
21 - FMAddr		(FMaps address and write enable)
