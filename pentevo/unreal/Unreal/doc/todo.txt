To Do:

! #FD decode - check cat-demo on out(#00fd),a
+ #FD lock port
+ TS Graphics
	+ modes: 16c, NoBorder
	+ rasters
	+ border update
	+ palette
	+ TS
	+ scrolls
* move the whole stuff on proper place in Full Border mode
+ INT position
+ INT vector
+ VDOS
+ TS-DOS ON/OFF with regard to RAM at #0000 (MEMCONFIG)
+ Turbo for CPU (divide actual tacts by factor)
+ Checks for 'No border' mode when raster is larger than 256x192 (the
  best way to do it is to resize the window up to raster size)

----------
For the 'Full Border' shit:

1. Bug with render crash if window is smaller that raste.
Add check when graphics mode is set to higher and forcibly extend the window.

2. Size of Full Border.
It doesn't feel right that full border has 384x300 odd size.
Visible ZX pixels on any display are 360x288.
So, need to fix the size on this value.

3. Odd raster position in Full Border.
Now it has such number of lines within raster:
(300 total)
256x192	320x200	320x240	360x288
64		60		40		16		- top border
192		200		240		288		- pixels
44		40		20		-4		- bottom border

Should be:
(288 total)
256x192	320x200	320x240	360x288
48		44		24		0		- top border
192		200		240		288		- pixels
48		44		24		0		- bottom border

So, need to:
a) move the Full Border renderers 16 lines higher
b) change window size to 288 lines
